# Project 2: Cryptography

This project involved using a Bleichenbacher attack in order to forge a signature on a server in order to run a form. Then, we used a padding oracle attack in order to decrypt a message from a web server.

# How to Run
Unfortunately, these attacks cannot be run due to needing a specific webserver that does not exist anymore. However, the code can be viewed in the files here.
